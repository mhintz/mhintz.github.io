After the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, we at Periscopic decided to create 
a visualization using data on homicides collected by the FBI. We looked in particular at 
killings by gun, which are so alarmingly frequent in the United States, and sought to highlight 
the tragedy of the loss of the victims' years of life. Using data from the World Health Organization, 
we put together a very rough life expectancy generator to give an idea of the amount of lost life.

This was my first major programming project at Periscopic, and represented a 
major learning experience for me. I spent a lot of time collaborating with the 
designer to get the look and feel just right.
