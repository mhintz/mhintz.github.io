At <a href="http://www.periscopic.com/" target="_blank">Periscopic</a>, I worked on the production of a project with the World Monuments Fund that highlights important cultural sites in Venice and Rome. The goal was to show off a large collection of media and other information about the cities in an intuitive, interesting, and visually appealing way.

Based on a design and concept by Periscopic's excellent design team, I wrote the code for this project. The design contains several layers of information and displays many different media types, including photos, video, sound recordings, and map captions. The main technical challenges in this project were handling the storage, organization, and embedding of diverse media types, creating a workflow for updating the media as the client provided it, and getting the touch interaction for the map tooltips juuuuust right.
