<h1>About Me</h1>
<p itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Person">
	I'm <span itemprop="name">Mark Hintz</span>, a <span itemprop="title">creative coder</span> at <a itemprop="affiliation" href="http://www.interactivethings.com/" target="_blank">Interactive Things</a>, a user experience and data visualization studio, where I build interactive tools that help users explore interesting stories found in datasets. I live and work in foggy <span itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address"><span itemprop="locality">ZÃ¼rich</span>, <span itemprop="region">Switzerland</span></span>.
</p>
<p>
	My proficiencies include a strong command of Javascript and HTML5, plus the occasional back end development in Python, PHP, Ruby, whatever. I can make a pixel-perfect implementation of any design, with flexible object-oriented architecture and readable code. I'm experienced at building apps from scratch using a modular, scalable Javascript architecture that incorporates data I/O, extensive user interaction, complex client-side data filtering, view updating and switching with lively motion and transitions, and accurate visual scales that precisely depict data quantities and differences.

<p>
	In general, I'm interested in creative visual and interactive applications of technology, including the web stack, data visualization, interactive visual art, and installations. In my spare time programming, I explore Processing, Cinder, OpenGL, and strange geometries. On my Github page, you can find code for some of my side projects.
