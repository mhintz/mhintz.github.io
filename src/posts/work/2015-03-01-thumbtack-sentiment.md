<a href="http://www.interactivethings.com/" target="_blank">Interactive Things</a> developed a tool for showing off the results of a survey conducted by Thumbtack (in association with Bloomberg).

The tool includes a coordinated map and line chart, and the ability to apply several different filters to explore dimensions of the data. I worked on the development of the front-end of the tool, and the pre-processing of the data for display.
