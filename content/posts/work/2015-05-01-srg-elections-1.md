As part of the run-up coverage of the national elections of 2015, <a href="http://www.interactivethings.com/" target="_blank">Interactive Things</a> designed and developed this look at Swiss elections data since 1971. The client was SRG/SRF, the Swiss national broadcasting corporation. We included an interactive map of all Swiss Gemeinde (municipalities), showing the strength of the different political parties' results in each election, and an area chart showing the relative strength changes over time. It charts the changing political landscape of Switzerland for the last 40 years.
