As a project for getting better acquainted with Rust, I wrote a basic half-edge mesh implementation, and used it to implement the QuickHull convex hull algorithm. This implementation was heavily based on a couple of examples I found online. The main reason for the project was to learn Rust's abstractions and to better understand mesh processing algorithms.

The implementation of QuickHull is <a href="https://github.com/mhintz/convex_hull" target="_blank">here</a>.
