            <h2>What's Cool About Art on the Net?</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Here's What's Cool:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Uses browser as medium</li>
              <li>Distributed over the internet, not through a gallery</li>
              <li>Intent of the art is often internet-related</li>
              <li>Access to all of the awesome features of the web as a platform</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <div>- Emphasize that the work is often inextricably part of the browser</div>
              <div>- Mention how revolutionary internet distribution is to the art world</div>
              <div>- Mention that the art often questions how we use the internet, and what the internet is doing to our attitudes, social lives, senses of self, etc.</div>
              <div>- Emphasize that the web as a platform is being developed and expanded every day, so the medium rapidly changes and improves. This is not a feature you get with, say, painting.</div>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2><a href="http://art.teleportacia.org/olia/summer/" target="_blank">Olia Lialina - Summer</a></h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Necessarily network and browser-based</li>
              <li>Carefree skipping between sites, like surfing</li>
              <li><a href="view-source:http://gli.tc/H/olia/summer/" target="_blank">(link to view-source)</a></li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <div>The piece is playful, even carefree, in the way that we often use the internet - hopping between different sites casually, like someone swinging.</div>

            <ul>
              <li>Made with Flash</li>
              <li>Like an online video, but straight in your face - no YouTube UI</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <div>- Emphasize that the piece is pretty much a video</div>
              <div>- There's no interaction, yet it clears away everything except the most essential thing.</div>
              <div>- It isn't a sharing platform or meant to be stopped and started. It's meant to be played all the way through, which is the experience of the art.</div>
              <div>- Note that many net art works exist, like this one, as a standalone web page that is entirely the art, and nothing more. (Not like, for instance, the way a flash game is presented).</div>

              <li>Uses popup windows as medium</li>
              <li>Soaked in memes</li>
              <li>Takes the music video away from VEVO and turns it into a standalone project/app</li>
              <li>Ironically, not possible to embed this video in another page</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <div>- One of my favorites.</div>
              <div>- Filled with jokes and statements about sites on the internet, the way we use the internet, and the way using the internet changes how we interact with each other.</div>
              <div>- Even the title is a sly pun about how, if his video is shared and embedded on other pages (or laid out, as in HTML), he'll get laid ("embedded").</div>

              <div>- Art that's interactive, participatory, shareable - like the internet!</div>

            <h1>Net Art:</h1>
            <h2>Why is Net Art Interesting?</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Here's Why:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Fundamental tension between the internet as an open platform and the concept of a possessable art work</li>
              <li>Art that exists on the internet is hard to own</li>
              <li>It's even harder to restrict access to it (within a gallery, for example)</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <div>- Internet is an open platform, and the source code for most Net Art is usually unobfuscated.</div>
              <div>- It's possible to visit a net art site, copy all the code, and reuse at will.</div>
              <div>- Users aren't expressly licensed to do so, but taking and remixing is part of Net Art culture (see Banger Briz piece, above)</div>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Net Art As Challenge to Art Establishment</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Net art represents an affront to the traditional art establishment predicated on ownership and exclusive access via a gallery</li>
              <li>Net art is easily distributed the world over to anyone with access to the internet</li>
              <li>(This is itself a form of privileged access, but that is a discussion for another session!)</li>
              <li>This status is often made explicit by the artist, e.g. if no yes . com</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <div>- Free distribution challenges traditional models of gallery viewing and private collection</div>
              <div>- Difficult for the big art institutions to work with net art, except by putting computers in the galleries.</div>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Net Art As Creative Use of The Internet</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The APIs now available in a browser have come a very long way</li>
              <li>(The influence of Flash on Net Art is not to be discounted)</li>
              <li>Building a web app for purely creative purposes is remarkably liberating</li>
              <li>(You should try it!)</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <div>- There's a pretty large creative coding community, including a sizeable chunk focused on the internet</div>
              <div>- Mention flash</div>
              <div>- Mention the incomplete overlap between net artists and creative coders</div>
              <div>- some net art is produced on a contract basis (e.g. Rafael Rozendaal)</div>
              <div>- You also see unofficial groups ("movements"?), like the tumblr community of people who make interesting gifs with Processing</div>
              <div>- Mention the liberating feeling of building an app for purely visual, creative purposes</div>

            <h2><a href="http://paddleson.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Paddles ON! Auction</a></h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Digital art auction</li>
              <li>Websites and GIFs for sale to collectors</li>
              <li>Works often were freely available to the public before auction (even open source), and remained so afterwards</li>
              <li>Represents a somewhat tentative, but (probably?) promising establishment acceptance of digital art and open art</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <div>- How odd is it that private art collectors have purchased gifs and html?</div>
              <div>- I expect a lot more of this kind of traditional establishment-net art crossover in the future.</div>
              <div>- Net Art is one of the hot areas of current contemporary art.</div>

              <div>- Understanding of fundamental 3D graphics concepts is often assumed, even in tutorials</div>
