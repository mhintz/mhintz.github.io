<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm currently working on a Master of Arts degree in Interaction Design at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. My focus is on emergent systems, generative design, and graphics programming. My proficiencies include graphics-oriented programming in C++ and Rust, a strong command of Javascript and the whole of HTML5, including WebGL, and backend web development. I've done a lot of work implementing interesting visual designs and interfaces, and I pride myself on writing flexible, general, and readable code.
<p>
  Before starting this program, I worked as an interactive developer, mostly for the web, at two small creative studios. Both studios, <a href="http://www.interactivethings.com/" target="_blank">Interactive Things</a> and <a href="http://www.periscopic.com/" target="_blank">Periscopic</a>, have a special focus on designing and building intuitive data visualizations which help users explore interesting stories found in datasets. I have extensive experience building web-based data visualizations from my time at these studios.
</p>
<p>
	In general, I'm interested in creative visual and interactive applications of technology, including graphics, data visualization, interactive visual art, and installations. I'm a mostly self-taught programmer, and my exploration interests include OpenGL, creative coding frameworks like Cinder, and strange geometries. You can find code for some of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/mhintz" target="_blank">my Github page</a>.
