### About Me

I'm a creative coder at <a href="http://www.periscopic.com" target="_blank">Periscopic</a>, a socially-conscious data visualization firm. I build interactive tools that help users explore interesting stories found in datasets.

My proficiencies include a strong grasp of Javascript and HTML5 plus backend development in PHP and Python. I can make a pixel-perfect implementation of any design, with flexible object-oriented architecture and clean, readable code.

I'm interested in creative applications of web technology, data visualization, interactive audiovisual installations, Processing, openFrameworks, Cinder, graphics programming, abstract geometry, and explorations of all kinds.
