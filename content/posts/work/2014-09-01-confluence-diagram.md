<a href="http://www.interactivethings.com/" target="_blank">Interactive Things</a> teamed up with a group of researchers at the University of St. Gallen to create this prototype for exploring constraint-balanced decision making. I was a member of the team of designers and developers that built the prototype. This project was the first time I worked with React.js in production.
