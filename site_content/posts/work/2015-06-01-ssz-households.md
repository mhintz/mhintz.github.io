This visualization was developed in collaboration with the statistical office of the city of Zurich, and used the library we had previously developed for them. A team at Interactive Things created a complex visualization with several coordinated charts, that was driven by a unique filter-selection mechanism. It also involved working with an illustrator to create the character personalities of the household group.
