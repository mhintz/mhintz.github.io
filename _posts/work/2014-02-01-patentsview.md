<a href="http://www.periscopic.com/" target="_blank">Periscopic</a> collaborated with the American Institutes for Research and the US Patents and Trademark Office to produce PatentsView, a prototype for examining a truly massive database of information on the origins and histories of US patents and their inventors.

Several Periscopic designers and developers were involved in producing an extensive application for exploring this database. We had to tackle the challenges inherent in working with large amounts of information, in both technology and design. When you're working with data sizes that push SQL to the limit, and are impossible to display on screen all at once, you face a unique challenge. For me, this project was an interesting and exciting introduction to working with data at scale.
