<a href="http://www.periscopic.com/" target="_blank">Periscopic</a> partnered with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to explore data on their sources of funding, and the size of programs that they use. 

I collaborated extensively with the designer to develop the site incrementally, adding features and improving on the existing design in a dynamic process. We had a mandate to design the most effective visualization based on our wireframes, and gradually evolved the final presentation from an initial prototype.
