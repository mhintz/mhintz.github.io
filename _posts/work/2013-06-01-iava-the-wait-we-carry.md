This was a project to visualize data collected from a survey of U.S. veterans of the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan that received support from the Veterans' Administration for medical 
conditions stemming from their service. These conditions included bodily aches and pains, 
stress injuries, psychological conditions, and physical injuries incurred in combat. Many 
veterans spent inordinate time waiting for the VA to process their requests for assistance.

I was the front-end developer for this project, which included a video intro and a 
large amount of user-supplied data. The data was unprocessed, so it was occasionally strange. 
The automatic video intro proved to be a challenge. This was the first project for which I used 
require.js to manage module and dependency loading, which expanded my understanding of 
object-oriented program architecture.
