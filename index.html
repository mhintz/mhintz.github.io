<h1>About Me</h1>
<p itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Person">
	I'm <span itemprop="name">Mark Hintz</span>, a <span itemprop="title">creative coder</span> at <a itemprop="affiliation" href="http://www.periscopic.com" target="_blank">Periscopic</a>, a socially-conscious data visualization firm. I live in <span itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address"><span itemprop="locality">Portland</span>, <span itemprop="region">Oregon</span></span>, and I build interactive tools that help users explore interesting stories found in datasets.
</p>
<p>
	My proficiencies include a strong grasp of Javascript and HTML5, and I can do backend development in PHP or Python. I can make a pixel-perfect implementation of any design, with flexible object-oriented architecture and readable code. I'm experienced at building apps from scratch using a modular, scalable Javascript architecture that incorporates data I/O, extensive user interaction, complex client-side data filtering, view updating and switching with lively motion and transitions, and accurate visual scales that precisely depict data quantities and differences.

<p>
	In general, I'm interested in creative visual and interactive applications of web technology, data visualization, interactive visual art, and installations. In my spare time programming, I explore Processing, Cinder, OpenGL graphics, and strange geometries. On my Github page, you can find code for some of my side projects.
